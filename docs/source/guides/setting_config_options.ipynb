    "This section provides an overview of the current config options that can be set within Woodwork.\n",

    "### Categorical Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The `categorical_threshold` config variable helps control the distinction between `Categorical` and other logical types during type inference.  More specifically, this threshold represents the maximum acceptable ratio of unique value count to total value count (excluding nan values from either count) in a series for that series to be inferred as categorical.  In other words, if the values in a series are fully accounted for by a relatively small collection of unique values, then the series is categorical.  The `categorical_threshold` config variable defaults to `0.2`.  This indicates that, by default, a series for which the unique value count is 20% of the total value count could be inferred as categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Categorical Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer numeric columns as the `Categorical` logical type if they have few enough unique values. The `numeric_categorical_threshold` controls this behavior.  The default value for `numeric_categorical_threshold` is `None`, meaning that by default numeric columns should never be inferred to be categorical.  If the setting is given a float between `0` and `1` as a value, then it behaves in the same manner as the `categorical_threshold` setting except that it only applies to columns with a numeric dtype (float or integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Email Inference Regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer string columns as the `EmailAddress` logical type if a representative sample of valid (non-missing) rows all match a given regular expression. The `email_inference_regex` config variable allows users to set the regular expression that is used during this matching process. The default regex is `r\"(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)\"` (taken from https://emailregex.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL Inference Regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer string columns as the `URL` logical type if a representative sample of valid (non-missing) rows all match a given regular expression. The `url_inference_regex` config variable allows users to set the regular expression that is used during this matching process. The default regex is `r\\\"(http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\\\(\\\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+)\\\"` (taken from https://urlregex.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### IP Address Inference Regex\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer string columns as the `IPAddress` logical type if a representative sample of valid (non-missing) rows all match a given regular expression. The `ipv4_inference_regex` and `ipv6_inference_regex` config variables allow users to set the regular expressions that are used during this matching process. The default for `ipv4_inference_regex` is taken from https://ipregex.com/ and the default for `ipv6_inference_regex` is taken from https://ihateregex.io/expr/ipv6/.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency Inference Window Length\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer frequency on columns which have temporal logical types. The `frequence_inference_window_length` configuration object is used to determine the length of the sliding window that is used for inference. The window length needs to be long enough to capture some frequency like Business Days, \"B\", etc.  The default value is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency Inference Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork provides the option to infer frequency on columns which have temporal logical types. The `frequence_inference_threshold` configuration object is used to determine the number of windows that satisify a given frequency out of all windows. For example, if 91 windows of 100 adhere to the frequency \"H\", then we can confidently assume the correct frequency for this data is \"H\".  The default value is 0.9."
