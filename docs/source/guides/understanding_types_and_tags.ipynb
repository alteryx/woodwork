    "## Definitions of Types and Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork has been designed to allow users to easily specify additional information about data contained in a data table, while providing interfaces to access the underlying data based on this additional information. Because a single data table may store various types of data in such as numbers, text or dates in different columns, the additional information is defined on a per-column basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Woodwork, there are three main ways users can specify additional information about their data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical Types\n",
    "* Logical Types\n",
    "* Semantic Tags"

    "### Physical Types\n",
    "Physical types define how the data is stored on disk or in memory. You may also see the physical type for a column referred to as the column's `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, typical physical types include `string`, `int64`, `float64` and `datetime64[ns]`, although there are many more. Within Woodwork, there are seven different physical types that are used. When a DataTable is created, the underlying physical type will be converted to one of these physical types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `boolean`\n",
    "* `category`\n",
    "* `datetime64[ns]`\n",
    "* `float64`\n",
    "* `Int64`\n",
    "* `string`\n",
    "* `timedelta64[ns]`"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Logical Types\n",
    "Logical types define how data should be interpreted or parsed. Logical types provide an additional level of detail beyond the physical type. Some columns might share the same physical type, but might have different parsing requirements, depending on the information that is stored in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, email addresses and phone numbers would typically both be stored in a data column with a physical type of `string`. However, when reading and validating these two types of information, very different rules apply. For email addresses, the presence of the `@` symbol is important. For phone numbers, you may want to confirm that only a certain number of digits are present and special characters might be restricted to `+`, `-`, `(` or `)`. In this particular example Woodwork defines two different logical types to separate these need: `EmailAddress` and `PhoneNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different logical types defined within Woodwork. To get a complete list of all the available logical types, you can use the `list_logical_types` function as shown below."

   "source": [
    "In the table of logical types shown below, you will notice that each logical type also has a specific `pandas_dtype` value associated with it. Within Woodwork, any time a logical type is set for a column, the physical type of the underlying data will be converted to the type shown in the `pandas_dtype` column. Within Woodwork, there is only one physical type associated with each logical type."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic tags define additional context about the meaning of a data column. This could directly impact how the information contained in the column is interpreted. Unlike physical types and logical types, semantic tags are much less restrictive. A column contain many semantic tags, or none at all. However, when assigning semantic tags, users should take care to not assign tags that have conflicting meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how semantic tags can be useful, let's consider a data set with two date columns: a signup date and a user birth date. Both of these columns will have the same physical type (`datetime64[ns]`) and both will have the same logical type (`Datetime`). However, semantic tags could be used to differentiate these columns. For example you might want to add the `date_of_birth` semantic tag to the user birth date column to indicate this column has special meaning and could be used to compute a user's age. Computing an age from the signup date column would not make sense, so the semantic tag can be used to differentiate between what the dates in these columns really mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Semantic Tags\n",
    "As you can see from the table that was generated with the `list_logical_types` function, Woodwork has some standard tags that can be applied to certain columns. Woodwork will add a standard set of semantic tags to columns with LogicalTypes that fall under certain, predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard tags are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'numeric'` - The tag applied to numeric LogicalTypes\n",
    "    * `WholeNumber`\n",
    "    * `Integer`\n",
    "    * `Double`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `'category'` - The tag applied to LogicalTypes that represent categorical variables\n",
    "    * `Categorical`\n",
    "    * `CountryCode`\n",
    "    * `Ordinal`\n",
    "    * `SubRegionCode`\n",
    "    * `ZIPCode`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two tags that get added on to index columns. If no index columns have been specified, these tags are not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'index'` - on the index column, when specified\n",
    "* `'time_index'` on the time index column, when specified\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of standard tags, excluding the `index` and `time_index` tags which have special meaning, can be controlled by the user. This will be discussed in more detail in the Working with Semantic Tags section below."

    "## Working with Logical Types\n",

    "When creating a DataTable, users have the option to specify the logical types for all, some, or none of the columns in the underlying dataframe. If logical types are defined for all of the columns, these logical types will be used, provided the data is compatible with the specified logical type. You cannot, for example, use a logical type of `Integer` on a column that contains text values that cannot be converted to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If users do not supply any logical type information during creating of the DataTable, Woodwork will infer the logical types based on the physical type of the column and the information contained in the columns.
