    "## Definitions of Types and Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork has been designed to allow users to easily specify additional information about data contained in a DataTable, while providing interfaces to access the underlying data based on this additional information. Because a single DataTable may store various types of data such as numbers, text or dates in different columns, the additional information is defined on a per-column basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main ways that Woodwork stores additional information about user data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory\n",
    "* Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted\n",
    "* Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used"

    "### Physical Types\n",
    "Physical types define how the data is stored on disk or in memory. You may also see the physical type for a column referred to as the column's `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, typical Pandas dtypes often used include `object`, `int64`, `float64` and `datetime64[ns]`, although there are many more. Within Woodwork, there are seven different physical types that are used, each corresponding to a Pandas dtype. When a DataTable is created, the dtype of the underlying data will be converted to one of these values, if it is not already one of these types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `boolean`\n",
    "* `category`\n",
    "* `datetime64[ns]`\n",
    "* `float64`\n",
    "* `Int64`\n",
    "* `string`\n",
    "* `timedelta64[ns]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical type conversion is done based on the `LogicalType` that has been specified or inferred for a given column."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Logical Types\n",
    "Logical types define how data should be interpreted or parsed. Logical types provide an additional level of detail beyond the physical type. Some columns might share the same physical type, but might have different parsing requirements depending on the information that is stored in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, email addresses and phone numbers would typically both be stored in a data column with a physical type of `string`. However, when reading and validating these two types of information, very different rules apply. For email addresses, the presence of the `@` symbol is important. For phone numbers, you may want to confirm that only a certain number of digits are present and special characters might be restricted to `+`, `-`, `(` or `)`. In this particular example Woodwork defines two different logical types to separate these parsing needs: `EmailAddress` and `PhoneNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different logical types defined within Woodwork. To get a complete list of all the available logical types, you can use the `list_logical_types` function as shown below."

   "source": [
    "In the table of logical types shown above, you will notice that each logical type has a specific `pandas_dtype` value associated with it. Within Woodwork, any time a logical type is set for a column, the physical type of the underlying data will be converted to the type shown in the `pandas_dtype` column. Within Woodwork, there is only one physical type associated with each logical type."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic tags define additional context about the meaning of a data column. This could directly impact how the information contained in the column is interpreted. Unlike physical types and logical types, semantic tags are much less restrictive. A column may contain many semantic tags, or none at all. However, when assigning semantic tags, users should take care to not assign tags that have conflicting meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how semantic tags can be useful, let's consider a data set with two date columns: a signup date and a user birth date. Both of these columns will have the same physical type (`datetime64[ns]`) and both will have the same logical type (`Datetime`). However, semantic tags could be used to differentiate these columns. For example you might want to add the `date_of_birth` semantic tag to the user birth date column to indicate this column has special meaning and could be used to compute a user's age. Computing an age from the signup date column would not make sense, so the semantic tag can be used to differentiate between what the dates in these columns really mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Semantic Tags\n",
    "As you can see from the table that was generated with the `list_logical_types` function above, Woodwork has some standard tags that are be applied to certain columns by default. Woodwork will add a standard set of semantic tags to columns with LogicalTypes that fall under certain, predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard tags are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'numeric'` - The tag applied to numeric Logical Types\n",
    "    * `Integer`\n",
    "    * `Double`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `'category'` - The tag applied to Logical Types that represent categorical variables\n",
    "    * `Categorical`\n",
    "    * `CountryCode`\n",
    "    * `Ordinal`\n",
    "    * `SubRegionCode`\n",
    "    * `ZIPCode`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two tags that get added to index columns. If no index columns have been specified, these tags are not present:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'index'` - on the index column, when specified\n",
    "* `'time_index'` on the time index column, when specified\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of standard tags, excluding the `index` and `time_index` tags, which have special meaning, can be controlled by the user. This will be discussed in more detail in the Working with Semantic Tags section below.\n",
    "There are a few different semantic tags defined within Woodwork. To get a list of the standard, index, and time index tags, you can use the `list_semantic_tags` function as shown below."
