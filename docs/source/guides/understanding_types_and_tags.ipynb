    "## Definitions of Types and Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork has been designed to allow users to easily specify additional typing information for a DataFrame while providing the ability to interface with the data based on the typing information. Because a single DataFrame might store various types of data like numbers, text, or dates in different columns, the additional information is defined on a per-column basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main ways that Woodwork stores additional information about user data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "* Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "* Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used."

   "source": [
    "### Physical Types\n",
    "Physical types define how the data is stored on disk or in memory. You might also see the physical type for a column referred to as the column’s `dtype`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, typical Pandas dtypes often used include `object`, `int64`, `float64` and `datetime64[ns]`, though there are many more. In Woodwork, there are 7 different physical types that are used, each corresponding to a Pandas dtype. When Woodwork is initialized on a DataFrame, the dtype of the underlying data is converted to one of these values, if it isn't already one of these types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `boolean`\n",
    "* `category`\n",
    "* `datetime64[ns]`\n",
    "* `float64`\n",
    "* `Int64`\n",
    "* `string`\n",
    "* `timedelta64[ns]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical type conversion is done based on the `LogicalType` that has been specified or inferred for a given column.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Woodwork with a Koalas DataFrame, the physical types used may be different than those listed above. For more information, refer to the guide [Using Woodwork with Dask and Koalas DataFrames](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/using_woodwork_with_dask_and_koalas.html#Notes-on-Koalas-Dtype-Conversions)."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Logical Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical types define how data should be interpreted or parsed. Logical types provide an additional level of detail beyond the physical type. Some columns might share the same physical type, but might have different parsing requirements depending on the information that is stored in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, email addresses and phone numbers would typically both be stored in a data column with a physical type of `string`. However, when reading and validating these two types of information, different rules apply. For email addresses, the presence of the `@` symbol is important. For phone numbers, you might want to confirm that only a certain number of digits are present, and special characters might be restricted to `+`, `-`, `(` or `)`. In this particular example Woodwork defines two different logical types to separate these parsing needs: `EmailAddress` and `PhoneNumber`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different logical types defined within Woodwork. To get a complete list of all the available logical types, you can use the `list_logical_types` function."

    "In the table, notice that each logical type has a specific `physical_type` value associated with it. Any time a logical type is set for a column, the physical type of the underlying data is converted to the type shown in the `physical_type` column. There is only one physical type associated with each logical type."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic tags provide more context about the meaning of a data column. This could directly affect how the information contained in the column is interpreted. Unlike physical types and logical types, semantic tags are much less restrictive. A column might contain many semantic tags or none at all. Regardless, when assigning semantic tags, users should take care to not assign tags that have conflicting meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how semantic tags can be useful, consider a dataset with 2 date columns: a signup date and a user birth date. Both of these columns have the same physical type (`datetime64[ns]`), and both have the same logical type (`Datetime`). However, semantic tags can be used to differentiate these columns. For example, you might want to add the `date_of_birth` semantic tag to the user birth date column to indicate this column has special meaning and could be used to compute a user’s age. Computing an age from the signup date column would not make sense, so the semantic tag can be used to differentiate between what the dates in these columns mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Semantic Tags\n",
    "As you can see from the table generated with the `list_logical_types` function above, Woodwork has some standard tags that are applied to certain columns by default. Woodwork adds a standard set of semantic tags to columns with LogicalTypes that fall under certain predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard tags are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'numeric'` - The tag applied to numeric Logical Types.\n",
    "    * `Integer`\n",
    "    * `Double`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* `'category'` - The tag applied to Logical Types that represent categorical variables.\n",
    "    * `Categorical`\n",
    "    * `CountryCode`\n",
    "    * `Ordinal`\n",
    "    * `SubRegionCode`\n",
    "    * `ZIPCode`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also 2 tags that get added to index columns. If no index columns have been specified, these tags are not present:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'index'` - on the index column, when specified\n",
    "* `'time_index'` on the time index column, when specified\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of standard tags, excluding the `index` and `time_index` tags, which have special meaning, can be controlled by the user. This is discussed in more detail in the Working with Semantic Tags section. There are a few different semantic tags defined within Woodwork. To get a list of the standard, index, and time index tags, you can use the `list_semantic_tags` function."
