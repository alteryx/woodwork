    "# Understanding Logical Types and Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Woodwork DataFrame, each column has three pieces of typing information associated with it: a physical type, a logical type, and semantic tags. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide offers an in-depth walk-through of all of the logical types and semantic tags that Woodwork defines in order to allow users to choose the logical types and semantic tags that most closely describe their data. As a reminder, here are quick definitions of Woodwork's types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "- Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "- Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woodwork will attempt to infer a column's `LogicalType` if none is supplied at initialization. A column's logical type will then inform which physical type and standard semantic tags are applied to it. However, setting the types manually will allow for more accurate typing of a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having accurate typing information on a Woodwork DataFrame impacts how the data is parsed, transformed, and later interpreted downstream of Woodwork initialization. Therefore, understanding Woodwork's logical types and semantic tags is essential to downstream usage of Woodwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth guide on how to set and manipulate these types, see the [Working with Types and Tags](working_with_types_and_tags.ipynb) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on how to customize Woodwork's type system, see the [Custom Types and Inference](custom_types_and_type_inference.ipynb) guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that Woodwork columns will always have a logical type and that any semantic tags that are added by Woodwork are meant to add additional meaning onto that logical type. We'll start out by looking in-depth at semantic tags so that when we get to logical types, we can better understand how a semantic tag might add additional information onto it."

    "#### Standard Tags\n",
    "Standard tags are associated with specific logical types. They are useful for indicating predefined categories that logical types might fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'numeric'` - Is applied to any numeric logical type\n",
    "    - **Uses**: Can select for just numeric columns when performing operations that require numeric columns\n",
    "    - **Related Properties**: `series.ww.is_numeric`\n",
    "- `'category'` - Is applied to any logical type that is categorical in nature\n",
    "    - **Uses**: Can select for just categorical columns when performing operations that require categorical columns\n",
    "    - **Related Properties**: `series.ww.is_categorical`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index Tags\n",
    "Index tags are added by Woodwork to a DataFrame when an `index` or `time_index` column is identified by the user. These tags have some special properties that are only confirmed to be true in the context of a DataFrame (so any Series with these tags may not have these properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'index'` - Indicates that a column is the DataFrame's index, or primary key\n",
    "    - There will only be one index column\n",
    "    - The contents of an index column will be unique\n",
    "    - An index column will have any standard semantic tags associated with its logical type removed\n",
    "    - In pandas DataFrames, the data in an index column will be reflected in the DataFrame's underlying index\n",
    "- `'time_index'`\n",
    "    - There will only be one time index column\n",
    "    - A time index column will contain either datetime or numeric data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Tags\n",
    "The tags listed below may be added directly to columns during or after Woodwork initialization. They are tags that have suggested meanings and that can be added to columns that will be used in the manner described below. Woodwork will neither add them automatically to a DataFrame nor take direct action upon a column if they are present. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `'date_of_birth'` - Indicates that a datetime column should be parsed as a date of birth\n",
    "- `'ignore'`/`'passthrough'` - Indicates that a column should be ignored during feature engineering or model building but should still be passed through these operations so that the column is not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional tags beyond the ones Woodwork adds at initialization may be useful for a DataFrame's interpretability, so users are encouraged to add any tags that will allow them to use their data more efficiently. \n",

    "- All logical types define a `dtype` that will get used for any column with that logical type - this is how the physical type for a column gets determined\n",
    "- All logical types perform some basic transformation into the expected physical type (`dtype`) - this is how Woodwork LogicalTypes act as a form of data-transformers. Depending on the requirements of a LogicalType, a LogicalType can transform input data into an expected format. \n",
