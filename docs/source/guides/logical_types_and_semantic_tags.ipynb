    "# Logical Types and Semantic Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Woodwork DataFrame, each column has three pieces of typing information: physical types, logical types, and semantic tags. When Woodwork is initialized on a DataFrame, Woodwork will attempt to infer these types if none are supplied at init.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining specific logical types or semantic tags for your data is important for building a table that contains the most specific type information as is possible. As Woodwork may transform your data to match the expected format of certain logical types, using the correct logical type is also a promise that the data that is that logical type matches a defined format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the correct types set is also important for downstream usage of the data. The purpose of having a type system is so that data can be confidently used for general machine learning projects in the most optimal way. For example, if Woodwork infers a categorical column as natural language, that will have an adverse impact any model built using the resulting types. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide offers an in-depth walk-through of all of the logical types and semantic tags that Woodwork defines. As a reminder, here are quick definitions of Woodwork's types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Physical Type: defines how the data is stored on disk or in memory.\n",
    "- Logical Type: defines how the data should be parsed or interpreted.\n",
    "- Semantic Tag(s): provides additional data about the meaning of the data or how it should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth guide on how to set and manipulate these types, see the [understanding types and tags guide](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/understanding_types_and_tags.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on how to customize Woodwork's type system, see the [custom types and inference guide](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/custom_types_and_type_inference.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that Woodwork columns will always have a logical type and that any semantic tags that are added by Woodwork are meant to add additional meaning onto the logical type. We'll start out by looking in-depth at semantic tags so that when we get to logical types, we can better understand how a semantic tag might add additional information onto it.\n"

    "In the DataFrame above, we can see a `parent_type` column. This concept of `LogicalType` classes having parents is not indicitive of a class-inheritence structure. We'll see below that all default `LogicalType`s that can show up in a Woodwork DataFrame are subclassed on the base `LogicalType` class. This parent-child relationship is something that comes from Woodwork's type system, which we describe in detail in the [custom types and type inference guide](https://woodwork.alteryx.com/en/stable/guides/custom_types_and_type_inference.html#Logical-Type-Relationships). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick summary to explain the `parent_type` column, it is indicitive of how type inference should rank inferred types. It's possible for data to be inferred as more than one Logical Type. For example, a column of all integers with no null values could be inferred as either `Integer` or `IntegerNullable`. `IntegerNullable` being the parent of `Integer` indicates that we know more about the contents of a column if it's able to be an `Integer` column (namely, that there are no null values), and Woodwork should infer a column as the Logical Type for which we know the most information.\n",

    "\n",
    "All logical types used by Woodwork are subclassed off of the base `LogicalType` class. Here we'll describe a bit about what the base LogicalType class (and therefore all subclasses) can do.\n",
    "- Define a `dtype` that will get used for a given LogicalType - this is how the physical type for a column gets determined\n",
    "- Allow for a basic transformation into the expected phs `dtype` - this is how Woodwork LogicalTypes act as a form of data-transformers. Depending on the requirements of a LogicalType, a LogicalType can define an expected format for any data applied to it and provide a method for transforming input data to that format. \n",
